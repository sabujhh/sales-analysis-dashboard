# Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a Power BI dashboard built from a retail sales dataset. The goal was to explore product performance, discounts, sales trends, and region-wise patterns. The report includes several interactive visuals and filters that allow users to drill down into the data and compare different time periods.

## 🔍 What the Dashboard Shows

### **1. Top/Bottom Products**
Visuals showing the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on:
- Sales  
- Profit  
- Quantity Sold  

This helps identify strong performers and products that may need attention.

---

### **2. Sales Trends Over Time**
Sales patterns displayed across:
- Daily  
- Monthly  
- Quarterly  
- Yearly  

Useful for spotting seasonality and analyzing long-term performance.

---

### **3. Sales vs Profit**
A scatter plot showing how sales relate to profit.  
Makes it easy to see products with high sales but low profit, or the opposite.

---

### **4. Compare Two Custom Time Periods**
The dashboard includes two separate date filters, allowing comparison of:
- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Quantity Sold  

between any two user-selected ranges.

---

### **5. Discount Analysis**
Average discount offered under each promotion category (e.g., clearance, seasonal sales, festive offers).

---

### **6. Total Number of Orders**
A simple KPI card showing total orders in the dataset.

---

### **7. Detailed Order Table**
A clean table that lists:
- Net Sales  
- Profit  
- Discount  
- Customer ID  
- Product details  
- Other order-level information  

All fields can be filtered using slicers for date, product, customer ID, and promotion categories.

---

### **8. Sales by City**
Map-based visualization showing which cities drive the highest sales.
